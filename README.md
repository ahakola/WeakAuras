# WeakAuras

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2

Import strings for WeakAuras either made or collected by me.

### T22 Auras require WAs version 2.10 or newer

### Some of these are really old and you shouldn't try to import them unless you know what you are doing, or you risk getting constant Lua-errors from outdated API-calls!

Pre-WoD stuff has been lost like tears in the rain. If you have WAs made/collected by me from that Pre-WoD-era, please forward them to me for archival purposes.
