## Legion - Suramar - Ancient Mana

Just shows the amount and the cap of your `[Ancient Mana]`. `[Ancient Mana]` is used as currency in Suramar-zone. I think this is now also part of the Currencies-group.


## Legion - Wakening Essence

Shows the amount of `[Wakening Essence]` you have on you. `[Wakening Essence]` is used to buy the legendary-items in Legion. I think this is now also part of the Currencies-group.
